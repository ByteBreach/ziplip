```
## Command

```bash
ziplip --file file.zip --password password.txt
```
- `--file <zip_file>` : Specifies the path to the zip file.

- `--password <password_file>` : Specifies the path to the file containing a list of passwords to try.

- Use the specified zip file and password file. Prints each password tried and indicates when the correct password is found.

```bash
ziplip --file file.zip --password password.txt -s
```
- `-s`, `--silent` : Silent mode. Only shows the correct password, does not print each password tried.

- Use the specified zip file and password file. Silent mode; only prints the correct password when found, without showing each password tried.

```bash
ziplip --file file.zip --password password.txt --only-pass
```
- `--only-pass` : Only prints the passwords as they are tried, does not indicate whether the password was correct or not.

- Use the specified zip file and password file. Only prints each password as it is tried, without indicating if it was correct or not.

```bash
ziplip --file file.zip --password password.txt -s --only-pass
```

- Use the specified zip file and password file. Silent mode with only passwords printed as they are tried. Does not indicate when the correct password is found, if found.

## Python Code Examples

- Using ziplip from a Python script:
```python
import ziplip

password = ziplip.main(zip_file="file.zip", password_file="password.txt")
if password:
    print("Password found:", password)
else:
    print("Password not found.")
```

- Using ziplip with silent mode from command line:

```python
import ziplip

password = ziplip.main(zip_file="file.zip", password_file="password.txt", silent=True)
if password:
    print("Password found:", password)
else:
    print("Password not found.")
```

- Using ziplip with only-print mode from command line:

```python
import ziplip

password = ziplip.main(zip_file="file.zip", password_file="password.txt", only_pass=True)
if password:
    print("Password found:", password)
else:
    print("Password not found.")
```

- Full Code

```python
import ziplip

# Example 1: Using ziplip from a Python script
password = ziplip.main(zip_file="file.zip", password_file="password.txt")
if password:
    print("Password found:", password)

# Example 2: Using ziplip with silent mode from a Python script
password = ziplip.main(zip_file="file.zip", password_file="password.txt", silent=True)
if password:
    print("Password found:", password)
else:
    print("Password not found.")

# Example 3: Using ziplip with only-print mode from a Python script
